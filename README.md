Hi
I am Rock Solid dedicated to building a direct tipping app
and a safety bluetooth device specifically for gig driver's across the nation.
Everyday we're out there and we wouldn't have  a gig without our tips from customer's.
I wish I could tell each one a Very Big ThanYou directly. People tip daily around the world. Alot of our tips are held back up to 48 hours,sometimes deducted to a lesser amount and the corporations control our tips. This is our platform our creation our money. without our customer and driver corporation's would be loosing alot of revenue.I come from the bottom to reach the top with out a doubt this idea needs to rise above make a statement  cause a movement. We as driver's deserve to converse with our customer to say thank you to ask how there day is. We make a difference in one another's daily life..Behind the scences big company's big money drivers big loss. Please help my dream become a driver reality and success!


Thankyou for your time
