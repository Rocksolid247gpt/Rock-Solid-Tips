  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p class="muted">
    Last updated: <script>document.write(new Date().toLocaleDateString());</script>
  </p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Rock Solid Tips is an independently developed direct-tipping concept designed to allow customers to tip service providers directly. Rock Solid Tips does not act as an employer, payment processor, or intermediary for tips.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Platform Affiliation</h2>
  <p>
    Rock Solid Tips is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or partnered with any delivery platform, gig company, or third-party service unless explicitly stated.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Any payments or tips made using links or QR codes associated with Rock Solid Tips are processed through third-party payment services chosen by the individual driver or service provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rock Solid Tips does not collect, hold, process, or distribute tip funds.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Fees, Subscriptions, and Use of Funds</h2>

<p>
  Access to certain Rock Solid Tips services may require a one-time joining fee and/or
  a recurring subscription fee. Current subscription pricing is disclosed at the time
  of enrollment and is subject to change with notice.
</p>

<p>
  Subscription fees are platform access and service fees. They are not tips, wages,
  gratuities, or compensation for delivery services.
</p>

<p>
  All tips paid by customers using Rock Solid Tips links or QR codes are intended for
  the exclusive benefit of the driver designated by the customer. Rock Solid Tips does
  not claim ownership of driver tips and does not treat tips as platform revenue.
</p>

<p>
  Subscription fees are maintained separately from driver tips and are not commingled
  with tip funds.
</p>

<p>
  Subscription funds may be used to operate, maintain, and improve the Rock Solid Tips
  platform, including administrative, technical, compliance, and support services.
</p>

<p>
  Subscription funds may be held in interest-bearing accounts or similar low-risk
  financial instruments. Any interest earned on subscription funds is platform revenue
  and may be used, at Rock Solid Tips’ discretion, to support platform operations and
  driver-focused programs such as emergency assistance, fee relief, or safety initiatives.
</p>

<p class="muted">
  Drivers do not earn individual interest on subscription fees. Subscription fees are
  not deposits, savings accounts, investment products, equity interests, or profit-sharing
  arrangements.
</p>

  <h2>5. No Guarantees</h2>
  <p>
    Rock Solid Tips makes no guarantees regarding tip amounts, payment timing, customer participation, or income.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    Rock Solid Tips, including its structure, workflow, branding, written content, and overall concept, is protected intellectual property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unauthorized duplication, imitation, or commercial use of this concept or its substantially similar features without express permission is prohibited.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    Rock Solid Tips shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or disputes arising from the use of third-party payment services or customer interactions.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of Rock Solid Tips constitutes acceptance of any revised terms.
