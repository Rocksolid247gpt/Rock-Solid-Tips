      <h1>💪 Rock Solid Tips (Short Manifesto)</h1>
      <p><span class="bold">Direct tips. No middleman. No delays. No BS.</span></p>
      <p>You worked for it. You earned it. You keep it.<br>
      Built by drivers. For drivers.<br>
      Powered by truth.</p>
      <p style="color: lightgreen;"><em>“Let the Rock Solid begin.”</em></p>
    </div><div class="section">
  <h2>💚 To the Drivers:</h2>
  <p>This is for every driver who got stiffed after sweating through traffic.<br>
  For the single moms, night grinders, early risers.<br>
  For the ones doing real work while the system eats the reward.</p>
  <p>This is your platform. This is your power.<br>
  <span class="bold">This is Rock Solid.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🚗 The Reality We Face:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Spark pays your tip in pieces? Not here.</li>
    <li>Instacart lets customers take back their tip days later? Not here.</li>
    <li>Apps hide what the customer really tipped? Not here.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="bold">Rock Solid Tips changes all of that.</span><br>
  You get your own direct tip link.<br>
  You control how you connect. You keep it all.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">We believe tips should go straight to the driver.</span><br>
    No slicing, no delays, no disappearing acts.</li>

    <li><span class="bold">We believe in transparency.</span><br>
    You should always know <em>what was tipped, when, and by whom.</em></li>

    <li><span class="bold">We believe in human connection.</span><br>
    Every driver deserves the right to thank their customer — not be silenced by a billion-dollar app.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Rock Solid Tips was created by someone who knows the grind — from Spark to Instacart and beyond. This platform exists because we got tired of watching big gig apps take <span class="bold">our tips</span>, hide <span class="bold">our totals</span>, delay <span class="bold">our pay</span>, and block us from even saying <span class="bold">thank you</span>.</p>

  <p>You did the job. You earned the gratitude.<br>
  <span class="bold">No middlemen. No games. No disappearing dollars.</span></p>
  <p>This isn’t just a tip platform. It’s a movement.</p>
