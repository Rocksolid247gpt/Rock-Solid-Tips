      <h2>Rock Solid Tips (Short Manifesto)</h2>
      <p><strong>Direct tips. No middleman. No delays. No BS.</strong><br>
      You worked for it. You earned it. You keep it.<br>
      Built by drivers. For drivers. Powered by truth.<br>
      <em>Let the Rock Solid begin.</em></p>
    </div><div class="section">
  <h2>To the Drivers:</h2>
  <p>This is for every driver who got stiffed after sweating through traffic.<br>
  For the single moms, side hustlers, night grinders, and early risers.<br>
  For the ones doing real work while the system eats the reward.<br><br>
  This is your platform.<br>
  This is your power.<br>
  <strong>This is Rock Solid.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The Reality We Face:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Spark pays your tip in pieces? Not here.</li>
    <li>Instacart lets customers take back their tip days later? Not here.</li>
    <li>Apps hide what the customer really tipped? Not here.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Rock Solid Tips changes all of that.</strong><br>
  You get your own direct tip link.<br>
  You control how you connect.<br>
  You keep it all.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Our Beliefs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We believe tips should go straight to the driver.</strong><br>
    No slicing, no delays, no disappearing acts.</li>
    <li><strong>We believe in transparency.</strong><br>
    You should always know <em>what was tipped, when, and by whom.</em></li>
    <li><strong>We believe in human connection.</strong><br>
    Every driver deserves the right to thank their customer — not be silenced by a billion-dollar app.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
  <p>Rock Solid Tips was created by someone who knows the grind — from Spark to Instacart and beyond.<br>
  This platform exists because we got tired of watching big gig apps take <strong>our tips</strong>, hide <strong>our totals</strong>, delay <strong>our pay</strong>, and block us from even saying <strong>thank you</strong>.<br><br>
  You did the job. You earned the gratitude.<br>
  <strong>No middlemen. No games. No disappearing dollars.</strong><br><br>
  This isn’t just a tip platform. It’s a movement.</p>
