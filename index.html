    <h1>Welcome to Rock Solid Tips</h1>

    <p>
      Rock Solid Tips was created through real struggle, long nights, and hard-earned experience. This is more than a website ‚Äî it‚Äôs a movement. Built for the ones out there delivering, showing up, and pushing forward even when nobody‚Äôs clapping.
    </p>

    <p>
      THANK YOU to every customer who supports us ‚Äî good deliveries, bad ones, rain, shine, it doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre the reason this platform exists ‚Äî so drivers can be recognized directly, personally, and proudly.

        Born from necessity. Powered by purpose. This platform was built independently with one goal ‚Äî create something lasting that gives back to drivers and puts gratitude back in the hands of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name means something deep: The Core (Corey) and The Brand (Brandon). Mentioned only once ‚Äî but forever part of the foundation.
